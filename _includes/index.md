#Welcome
This is a proof of concept implementation of DOCter, an open-source documentation tool developed at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Having forked <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/docter/">the repository from CFPB</a>, we created a new repository we call BEA-DOCter.

The homepage content can be edited as markdown in _includes/index.html or directly within the index.html file. We suggest modifying the _includes/index.html file.

This is an open-source project.
